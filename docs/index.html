<main>
<p>The Turing Technical Reports Series provides a public, citable
repository of technical reports. It is suitable for publication of
long-form reports, project reports to funders, material that is
primarily expository, case studies, position papers, and PhD theses.
(This list is not exhaustive.) It is not suitable for articles that are
destined for publication in a journal or conference proceedings.</p>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:tech-reports@turing.ac.uk"
class="email">tech-reports@turing.ac.uk</a> from your Turing email
account attaching a copy of the report you wish to publish (which need
not be final). We will ask you to provide a title, abstract, and author
list, and possibly other metadata. These should use only Unicode
text.</p>
<p>The editorial process is lightweight but not non-existent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical Reports are intended to be of interest to some part of
the AI or data science community (although it is fine if that part
consists predominantly of the Turing Institute itself).</p>
<p>We expect that most reports produced by members of the Turing will be
suitable but the series is not intended as an archive of <em>all</em>
material generated in the course of our work. If there is any debate as
to the suitability of a particular report for inclusion in this series,
the views of the Chief Scientist and the relevant Science and Innovation
Director will be sought.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Reports should be of “publication quality,” written in
a professional tone and prepared carefully, with attention to such
details as references, spelling, formatting, and general accuracy. For
example principles for scholarly work, see the general submission
instructions from arXiv.</p></li>
<li><p>The final report should be a pdf, formatted for A4 paper. Page
numbering should start on page 3, as a standard cover sheet will be
added.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We expect that these instructions will change over time. Please let
the editors know if the current process could be improved or is not
working for you.</p>
