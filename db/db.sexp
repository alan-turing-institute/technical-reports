;; This file contains the metadata for all technical reports. The
;; format is a sequence of s-expressions, each of which describes one report.
;; It was inspired by the Cambridge Laboratory Technical Reports database.

;; Format
;; ------
;;
;; Each report is a list of the form
;; (report
;;   (<field-name> <field-value>)
;;   ... )
;;
;; Note that each field is list of two elements (not a pair!)
;; The <field-value> may be an atomic value or a list, depending on the field.
;;
;; The possible <field-names> are:
;;
;; number: a natural number
;; title: a string
;; authors: a list of authors, where an author is either a string (the
;;          name) or a list of a string followed by identifiers.
;; date: a list of up to three numbers, being the year, month, and day
;; keywords: a list of strings
;; doi: a string

;; TODO
;; - add abstracts
;; - add copyright date as an optional field

 (abstract
  "Cyber defence is one side of a dynamic and ever-evolving confrontation with attackers who seek to exploit weaknesses and cause unintended behaviour in digital systems. Historically both attackers and defenders have relied on human creativity and intellect to outdo one another, learning from each otherâ€™s tactics in a competitive,emergent, ad hoc curriculum. Modern cyber combatants increasingly rely on a variety of automated tools, machine learning; and perhaps more surprisingly, game playing in the pursuit of their goals. Whilst autonomous agents based on deep reinforcement learning have made tremendous breakthroughs playing complex strategy games such as Go, StarCraft, and Stratego, comparatively little progress has been witnessed in cyber defence games and the real-world problems they relate to. We highlight the current state of autonomous agents in cyber defence, presage their considerable future potential, and identify key research challenges both near and far.")
