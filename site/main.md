% The Alan Turing Institute 
  Technical Reports Series
  (DRAFT)

The Turing Technical Reports Series provides a public, citable
repository of technical reports. It is suitable for publication of
long-form reports, project reports to funders, material that is
primarily expository, case studies, position papers, and PhD
theses. (This list is not exhaustive.) It is not suitable for articles
that are destined for publication in a journal or conference
proceedings.

(The reports below are not real reports.)

## Submission instructions

Please email <tech-reports@turing.ac.uk> from your Turing email
account attaching a copy of the report you wish to publish (which need
not be final). We will ask you to provide a title, abstract, and
author list, and possibly other metadata. These should use only
Unicode text.

The editorial process is lightweight but not non-existent:

- Technical Reports are intended to be of interest to some part of the
  AI or data science community (although it is fine if that part
  consists predominantly of the Turing Institute itself). 
  
  We expect that most reports produced by members of the Turing will
  be suitable but the series is not intended as an archive of _all_
  material generated in the course of our work. If there is any debate
  as to the suitability of a particular report for inclusion in this
  series, the views of the Chief Scientist and the relevant Science
  and Innovation Director will be sought.

- Technical Reports should be of “publication quality,” written in a
  professional tone and prepared carefully, with attention to such
  details as references, spelling, formatting, and general
  accuracy. For example principles for scholarly work, see the general
  submission instructions from arXiv.
  
- The final report should be a pdf, formatted for A4 paper. Page
  numbering should start on page 3, as a standard cover sheet will be
  added.

We expect that these instructions will change over time. Please let
the editors know if the current process could be improved or is not
working for you.
